# Using the PRG Method to Avoid Refresh Issues

# What is the PRG Method?
The Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) method is a design pattern used to prevent duplicate form submissions caused by page refreshes. It works by redirecting users after a form submission, ensuring that refreshing the page does not resubmit the form.

# How Does PRG Work?
1. Post: The user submits a form, and the server processes it via a  POST request.
2. Redirect: Instead of returning a response, the server redirects the user to a new page.
3. Get: The browser performs a GET request to the new page, displaying a confirmation or results page.

# Why Use PRG?
Prevents duplicate entries or actions caused by accidental page refreshes.
Improves user experience by breaking the link between form submission and the page state.
Ensures data consistency and reduces server-side errors.


By using the PRG method, you can enhance your application's stability and avoid common issues with form resubmission.
